# MSX-UNAPI specification

MSX-UNAPI is a standard procedure for defining, discovering and using new APIs (Application Program Interfaces) for MSX computers, intended primarly (but not exclusively) to allow hardware manufacturers to provide consistent and standarized APIs. UNAPI is short for "UNified API definition and discovery procedure".

This repository contains the following documents:

* [Introduction to MSX-UNAPI](docs/Introduction%20to%20MSX-UNAPI.md): You might want to start here to get a high-level overview of what UNAPI is and how it works.

* [MSX-UNAPI specification](docs/MSX%20UNAPI%20specification%201.1.md): The full core specification document, covering all the details on how to design an API, how to implement it, and how to discover and consume it from a client application.

* [Ethernet UNAPI specification](docs/Ethernet%20UNAPI%20specification%201.1.md): The specification of an API for Ethernet cards.

* [TCP/IP UNAPI specification](docs/TCP-IP%20UNAPI%20specification.md): The specification of an API for TCP/IP stacks.

Also there are a couple of directories with code: [examples](/examples) and [tools](/tools). For the later, binaries are available in the [releases](https://github.com/Konamiman/MSX-UNAPI-specification/releases) section.
