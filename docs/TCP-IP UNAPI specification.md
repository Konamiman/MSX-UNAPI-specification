## 1. Introduction

MSX-UNAPI is a standard procedure for defining, discovering and using new APIs
(Application Program Interfaces) for MSX computers. The MSX-UNAPI specification is
described [in a separate document](MSX%20UNAPI%20specification%201.1.md).

This document describes an UNAPI compliant API intended for software that implements
a TCP/IP stack, that is, software that provides networking capabilities by using the IP
family of protocols. The functionality provided by this API is focused mainly on
communicating with other computers by using the TCP and UDP protocols, but there are
also some additional routines that allow for example performing domain name resolution
by querying DNS servers.

The intended client software applications for this API are networking related applications
such as Telnet, FTP or e-mail clients. Any software willing to transmit or receive data by
using the TCP or UDP protocols can make use of implementations of this specification.
This document is targeted at both developers of TCP/IP UNAPI implementations, and
developers of client applications for these implementations.

### 1.1. Design goals

There were two main goals when designing this specification:

* _Simplicity_. This specification's intent is to provide the simplest API that will allow
to develop useful networking applications for MSX computers.

* _Modularity_. Most of the capabilities provided by this API are optional, and there
are means to get information about which capabilities are supported by a given
implementation. This allows to create from minimal to complete
implementations, as well as providing a clean way to develop an implementation
in an incremental way.

### 1.2. Specification scope

In order to achieve the simplicity goal, this specification deals with the most basic
capabilities required in order to develop client networking applications. These capabilities
are:

* Communicating via TCP connections.
* Communicating via UDP datagrams.
* Converting domain names to IP addresses by querying DNS servers.
* Sending ICMP echo request messages (PINGs) and retrieving their answers.
* Communicating via raw IP datagrams.

Other capabilities that are usually part of TCP/IP stacks, but which are not necessary in
order to develop most client applications, are not covered by this specification. In
particular, this specification does NOT deal with:

* The link layer protocol / physical transport medium used (serial cable, modem,
Ethernet network, wireless network, joystick cable, or whatever medium is
used).
* The procedure for establishing and closing a network connection, if applicable.
* The configuration parameters of the implementation, other than basic
parameters such as the IP addresses to use and wether to set these IP
addresses manually or automatically (for example setting the user name and
password for establishing a network connection is not covered).
* Sending and receiving ICMP messages, other than echo messages (PINGs).
* Configuring routing tables.
* Converting IP addresses into hardware addresses using ARP or an equivalent
protocol, when applicable.

Note that this does not impose any restriction on implementations for actually providing
these features. For example, an implementation may deal internally with ICMP
messages; an Ethernet based implementation will most probably use ARP to convert IP
addresses to hardware addreses; and it is expected that implementations will be
delivered with the appropriate advanced configuration tools, when needed. The key
concept is that these capabilities may exist but are not covered by this specification.

### 1.3. Modularity

In order to achieve the modularity goal, most of the capabilities defined in this
specification are optional; implementations may choose to implement the full
specification, or only a subset of it. Of course, the less capabilities are implemented by a
given implementation, the greater are the chances that a particular client application will
not work with it, especially the most basic capabilities. For example, an implementation
not providing any support for TCP connections will not be very useful; on the other hand,
an implementation that supports TCP and UDP but does not support raw IP connections
will probably still work fine with most client applications.

The modularity feature is implemented in two ways:

1. There is a routine, [TCPIP_GET_CAPAB](#412-tcpip_get_capab-get-information-about-the-tcpip-capabilities-and-features), that returns a
"capabilities vector". This vector holds one bit for each capability that is defined
in this specification; when the bit is set it means that the capability is
implemented.
2. All routines defined in this specification return an error code in register A. One of
these codes is "Not implemented", and is returned whenever a routine related to
an unimplemented capability is invoked (certain routines return this error or not
depending on the input parameters).

For more details on which routines can be invoked (and how) depending on the
supported capabilities, see the routines descriptions themselves.

## 2. API identifier and version

The API identifier for the specification described in this document is: "TCP/IP" (without
the quotes). Remember that per the UNAPI specification, API identifiers are caseinsensitive.
The TCP/IP API version described in this document is 1.1. This is the API specification
version that the mandatory implementation information routine must return in DE (see
[UNAPI_GET_INFO](#411-unapi_get_info-obtain-the-implementation-name-and-version)).

## 3. Error codes

All routines defined in this specification return an error code in register A. This section
lists all the possible error codes; the numeric value, a mnemonic and a short description
is provided for each one. Each routine description has an errors section which explains
with detail which error codes can be returned for that routine, and for which reasons is
each one returned.

| Code  | Mnemonic  | Description  |
|----|---|---|
| 0  | ERR_OK  | Operation completed successfully  |
| 1  | ERR_NOT_IMP  | Capability not implemented  |
| 2  | ERR_NO_NETWORK  | No network connection available  |
| 3  | ERR_NO_DATA  | No incoming data available  |
| 4  | ERR_INV_PARAM  | Invalid input parameter  |
| 5  | ERR_QUERY_EXISTS  | Another query is already in progress  |
| 6  | ERR_INV_IP  | Invalid IP address  |
| 7  | ERR_NO_DNS  | No DNS servers are configured  |
| 8  | ERR_DNS  | Error returned by DNS server  |
| 9  | ERR_NO_FREE_CONN  | No free connections available  |
| 10 | ERR_CONN_EXISTS  | Connection already exists  |
| 11 | ERR_NO_CONN  | Connection does not exists  |
| 12 | ERR_CONN_STATE  | Invalid connection state  |
| 13 | ERR_BUFFER  | Insufficient output buffer space  |
| 14 | ERR_LARGE_DGRAM  | Datagram is too large  |
| 15 | ERR_INV_OPER  | Invalid operation  |

## 4. API routines

This version of the TCP/IP API consists of 30 mandatory routines, which are described
below. API implementations may define their own additional implementation-specific
routines, as described in the MSX-UNAPI specification.

Routines are grouped in subsections by related behavior. Useful information concerning
all the routines on a given subsection is provided at the beginning of each subsection.
Some routines exchange data with the client application by using a memory buffer. Per
the UNAPI specification, implementations may not allow the destination address to be a
page 1 address (in the range 4000h-7FFFh). Client software should not use this range as
destination address when invoking these routines, in order to correctly interoperate with
such implementations.

### 4.1. Information gathering routines

These routines allow to obtain various information about the implementation capabilities,
working parameters, and current state.

### 4.1.1. UNAPI_GET_INFO: Obtain the implementation name and version

* Input:
  * A = 0

* Output:
  * A = Error code
  * HL = Address of the implementation name string
  * DE = API specification version supported. D=primary, E=secondary.
  * BC = API implementation version. B=primary, C=secondary.

This routine is mandatory for all implementations of all UNAPI compliant APIs. It returns
basic information about the implementation itself: the implementation version, the
supported API version, and a pointer to the implementation description string.

The implementation name string must be placed in the same slot or segment of the
implementation code (or in page 3), must be zero terminated, must consist of printable
characters, and must be at most 63 characters long (not including the terminating zero).
Refer to the MSX-UNAPI specification for more details.

**ERROR CODES**

This routine never fails. ERR_OK is always returned.

### 4.1.2. TCPIP_GET_CAPAB: Get information about the TCP/IP capabilities and features

* Input:
  * A = 1
  * B = Index of information block to retrieve:
    * 1: Capabilities and features flags, link level protocol
    * 2: Connection pool size and status
    * 3: Maximum datagram size allowed
    * 4: Second set of capabilities and features flags

* Output:
    *  A = Error code

    When information block 1 requested:

    * HL = Capabilities flags
    * DE = Features flags
    * B = Link level protocol used

    When information block 2 requested:

    * B = Maximum simultaneous TCP connections supported
    * C = Maximum simultaneous UDP connections supported
    * D = Free TCP connections currently available
    * E = Free UDP connections currently available
    * H = Maximum simultaneous raw IP connections supported
    * L = Free raw IP connections currently available

    When information block 3 requested:

    * HL = Maximum incoming datagram size supported
    * DE = Maximum outgoing datagram size supported

    When information block 4 requested:

    * HL = Second set of capabilities flags
    * DE = Second set of features flags (currently unused, always zero)

As explained in ["Modularity"](#13-modularity), the TCP/IP UNAPI specification is modular, meaning that
implementators may choose to include only a certain funcionality subset in the
developed implementations. This is the routine that gives information about the
capabilities actually available in the implementation in which it is invoked. It also
provides information about other implementation working parameters that may be useful
for client applications.

The **capabilities flags** is the most important piece of information, and should be
retrieved by all client applications at startup time, before trying to actually perform any
TCP/IP related operation. It consists of a bitfield in which each bit is associated to one of
the capabilities provided by the routines described in this specification. When the bit is
one, the capability is available, and client applications can safely invoke the routines that
provide the capability. When the bit is zero, the capability is not implemented, and trying
to invoke any of the associated routines will result in the routine returning a
ERR_NOT_IMP error code. (Some routines depend on a given capability or not depending
on the input parameters; more details are given on each routine description).

The first set of capabilities flags (returned whe information block 1 is requested) is as follows.
Bit 0 is LSB of register L, bit 8 is LSB of register H.

* Bit 0: Send ICMP echo messages (PINGs) and retrieve the answers
* Bit 1: Resolve host names by querying a local hosts file or database
* Bit 2: Resolve host names by querying a DNS server
* Bit 3: Open TCP connections in active mode
* Bit 4: Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified remote socket
* Bit 5: Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unsepecified remote socket
* Bit 6: Send and receive TCP urgent data
* Bit 7: Explicitly set the PUSH * Bit when sending TCP data
* Bit 8: Send data to a TCP connection before the ESTABLISHED state is reached
* Bit 9: Discard data in the output buffer of a TCP connection
* Bit 10: Open UDP connections
* Bit 11: Open raw IP connections
* Bit 12: Explicitly set the TTL and ToS for outgoing datagrams
* Bit 13: Explicitly set the automatic reply to PINGs on or off
* Bit 14: Automatically obtain the IP addresses, by using DHCP or an equivalent protocol (deprecated)
* Bit 15: Get the TTL and ToS for outgoing datagrams

The second set of capabilities flags (returned whe information block 4 is requested) is as follows.

* Bit 0: Automatically obtain the local IP address, subnet mask and default gateway, by using DHCP or an equivalent protocol
* Bit 1: Automatically obtain the IP addresses of the DNS servers, by using DHCP or an equivalent protocol
* Bit 2: Manually set the local IP address
* Bit 3: Manually set the peer IP address
* Bit 4: Manually set the subnet mask IP address
* Bit 5: Manually set the default gateway IP address
* Bit 6: Manually set the primary DNS server IP address
* Bit 7: Manually set the secondary DNS server IP address
* Bit 8: Use [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) in TCP active connections
* Bit 9: Use [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) in TCP passive connections
* Bits 10-15: Unused

Bit 14 of the primary set is deprecated and kept for compatibility with version 1.0 of the specification.
It must be set if at least one of bits 0 and 1 of the secondary set is set.

The **features flags** provide additional information about the internal working
parameters of the implementation. These parameters have no direct influence on the
specification routines (no ERR_NOT_IMP error will ever be returned as a result of one of
these features being missing), but client applications may indirectly make use of this
information to decide how to behave.

The first (and currently only) set of features flags (returned whe information block 1 is requested) is as follows.
Bit 0 is LSB of register E, bit 8 is LSB of register D.

* Bit 0: Physical link is point to point
* Bit 1: Physical link is wireless
* Bit 2: Connection pool is shared by TCP, UDP and raw IP (see explanation about maximum simultaneus connection support below)
* Bit 3: Checking network state requires sending a packet in looback mode, or other expensive (time consuming) procedure
* Bit 4: The TCP/IP handling code is assisted by external hardware
* Bit 5: The loopback address (127.x.x.x) is supported
* Bit 6: A host name resolution cache is implemented
* Bit 7: IP datagram fragmentation is supported
* Bit 8: User timeout suggested when opening a TCP connection is actually applied
* Bit 9: TTL can be specified in the parameters block of [TCPIP_SEND_ECHO](#421-tcpip_send_echo-send-icmp-echo-message-ping)
* Bit 10: [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query) is a blocking operation
* Bit 11: [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection) is a blocking operation
* Bit 12: The server certificate can be verified when opening a TCP connection with TLS in [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection)
* Bits 13-15: Unused

**Note for client application developers:** Bit 15 of the first set of capabilities flags, 
the entire second set of capabilities flags, and bits 9-12 of the first set of features flags
were introduced in version 1.1 of the specification. They aren't presend on implementations of version 1.0.

The **link level protocol used** byte may be one of the following. Future versions of this
specification may define additional codes.

* 0: Other/Unespecified
* 1: SLIP
* 2: PPP
* 3: Ethernet
* 4: WiFi

The **connection pool size and status** block informs about how many TCP, UDP and
raw IP connections can be handled simultaneously by the implementation, as well as
how many free connections are currently available. If the TCP, UDP or raw IP protocols
are not supported at all (as indicated in the capabilities flags), then the maximum and
free connection count for that protocol should be returned as zero.

When the _"Connection pool is shared by TCP, UDP and raw IP"_ feature bit is set, it
means that there is one single group of free connections for both TCP, UDP and raw IP,
rather than one separate group for each protocol. This implies that the "maximum
simultaneuos connections" and "current free connections" values always will be the same
for all three protocols, and opening a new connection for any of the protocols will cause
all three free connection counters to decrease.

The **maximum datagram size allowed** block informs about the maximum size of IP
datagrams (including IP and higher level protocol headers, but not including any link
level header) the implementation can handle. The implementation may silently discard
any incoming datagrams larger than the maximum incoming datagram size, but client
applications may usually ignore this fact. More important is the maximum outgoing
datagram size, since client applications need to take in account this value when
performing an operation that involves directly sending datagrams (such as sending UDP
data or raw IP datagrams).

All implementations are required to support a minimum datagram size of 576 bytes, as
per the IP protocol specification.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The requested information block has been returned.

* ERR_INV_PAR

Invalid information block index specified.

### 4.1.3. TCPIP_GET_IPINFO: Get IP address

* Input: 
  * A = 2
  * B = Index of address to obtain:
    * 1: Local IP address
    * 2: Peer IP address
    * 3: Subnet mask
    * 4: Default gateway
    * 5: Primary DNS server IP address
    * 6: Secondary DNS server IP address

* Output:
  * A = Error code
  * L.H.E.D = Requested address

This routine returns one of the IP address parameters used by the implementation, as
currently configured. If an address is not configured, then it is returned as 0.0.0.0.

The addresses are returned in the format L.H.E.D. For example, 1.2.3.4 is returned as
HL=0201h, DE=0403h. This makes easier to store and retrieve addresses in memory
using simple `ld (IP),hl : ld(IP+2),de` or equivalent instructions.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The requested IP address has been returned.

* ERR_INV_PAR

An invalid value for B has been specified at input, or the specified address type does not
make sense for the implementation (for example the subnet mask or the default
gateway when the link layer protocol is PPP, or the peer address on an Ethernet
network).

### 4.1.4. TCPIP_NET_STATE: Get network state

* Input: 
  * A = 3

* Output:
  * A = Error code
  * B = Current network state:
    * 0: Closed
    * 1: Opening
    * 2: Open
    * 3: Closing
    * 255: Unknown

This routine returns the current state of the network availability. It is only possible to
send and receive data when the network state is "Open"; it may or may not be possible
as well when the returned state is "Unknown".

The "Closed" state may refer to a logical close (for example, no connection has been
established in case of serial communications using the PPP protocol) or to a physical
medium unavailability (for example, no cable is connected in case of an Ethernet
network).

The "Opening" state means that the implementation is actively trying to reach the
"Open" state, but the actions that are actually performed for this depend on each
implementation. For example, it may mean "connecting to the ISP" in case of modem
communications, or "obtaining addresses via DHCP" in case of an Ethernet network.

There are no restrictions on the possible transitions from any of these states to any
other. For example, an implementation could pass from "Opening" to "Closed" again if an
error is detected during the opening process. Or, it could toggle between "Open" and
"Closed" directly if no special setup or shutdown process is required.

Implementations should return the "Checking network state requires an expensive
procedure" feature flag set if calling this routine implies performing a time consuming
procedure (such as sending a loopback packet), in order to inform client that it should
not be called too often.

**ERROR CODES**

This routine never fails. ERR_OK is always returned.

### 4.2. ICMP echo request (PING) routines

These routines allow to send ICMP echo request messages (known as PINGs) and to
retrieve the received responses.

### 4.2.1. TCPIP_SEND_ECHO: Send ICMP echo message (PING)

* Input:
  * A = 4
  * HL = Address of echo parameters block

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

This routine sends an ICMP echo request (a PING) with the specified parameters. A
parameters block with the following format must be supplied:

* +0 (4): IP address of the destination machine
* +4 (1): TTL for the datagram
* +5 (2): ICMP identifier
* +7 (2): ICMP sequence number
* +9 (2): Data length, 0 to maximum datagram size - 28

The datagram will be send with the value specified if the _"TTL can be specified in the parameters block of
TCPIP_SEND_ECHO"_ feature flag is set. If it isn't, the implementation will choose by itself the value to use.

It is possible to choose the size of the data area of the ICMP message, but not its
contents; these must be always the byte sequence 0 1 2 ... 253 254 255 0 1 2...
appropriately truncated to match the specified size.

The identifier and the data number can help on matching requests and replies (an echo
reply will always have these values identical to the ones of its associated echo request),
they can be any 16 bit number. The TTL value should normally be set to 255, in order to
maximize the probability of the packet arriving to its destination.

Replies to ICMP echo messages (in the form of ICMP echo response messages) can be
obtained by using the [TCPIP_RCV_ECHO](#422-tcpip_rcv_echo-retrieve-icmp-echo-response-message) routine.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The ICMP echo message packet has been sent.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Send ICMP echo messages"_ capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support sending ICMP echo messages.

* ERR_NO_NETWORK

There is no network connection available.

* ERR_LARGE_DGRAM

Invalid data length specified. The maximum data length allowed is equal to the
maximum outgoing datagram size minus 28 (the size of the IP and ICMP headers
combined).

### 4.2.2. TCPIP_RCV_ECHO: Retrieve ICMP echo response message

* Input: 
  * A = 5
  * HL = Address for the echo parameters block

* Output:
  * A = Error code

This routine retrieves the parameters associated to the oldest received ICMP echo
response message (usually received as a reply of an echo message sent via
[TCPIP_SEND_ECHO](#421-tcpip_send_echo-send-icmp-echo-message-ping)), and copies them to the address supplied in HL. It also removes the
message information from the implementation internal buffers, so that the next call to
this routine will either return information for the next message received, or a
ERR_NO_DATA error if no more messages are available. Implementations are required to
have internal buffer space to hold data for only one echo response message, but may
choose to provide space for more than one; echo response messages received when the
buffer space is full are silently discarded.

The parameters block has the same format as the one used by [TCPIP_SEND_ECHO](#421-tcpip_send_echo-send-icmp-echo-message-ping), only
that now the parameters refer to the received echo response message, not to a message
to be sent. It is not possible to retrieve the data part of the echo response messages
received.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The ICMP echo response message parameters have been copied to the specified address.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Send ICMP echo messages"_ capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support receiving ICMP echo response messages.

* ERR_NO_DATA

No new ICMP echo response messages have been received and the implementation's
buffer for incoming messages is empty.

### 4.3. Host name resolution routines

These routines allow to resolve a host name, that is, to convert host names to the
appropriate IP addresses. Depending on the supported capabilities, host names may be
resolved by using a local hosts file or equivalent mechanism, by querying a DNS server,
or both.

### 4.3.1. TCPIP_DNS_Q: Start a host name resolution query

* Input: 
  * A = 6
  * HL = Address of the host name to be resolved, zero terminated
  * B = Flags, when set to 1 they instruct the resolver to:
    * bit 0: Only abort the query currently in progress, if there is any (other flags and registers are then ignored)
    * bit 1: Assume that the passed name is an IP address, and return an error if this is not true
    * bit 2: If there is a query in progress already, do NOT abort it and return an error instead

* Output:
  * A = Error code
  * B = status after the routine returns:
    * 0: a query to a DNS server is in progress
    * 1: the name represented an IP address
    * 2: the name could be resolved locally
  * L.H.E.D = Resolved IP address (only if no error occurred and B=1 or 2 is returned)

This routine, together with its counterpart [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) 
explained later, allows to obtain
the IP address associated to a given host name (for example "smtp.mailserver.com"),
which may be up to 255 characters long. To achieve this, the DNS servers whose IP
addresses are currenly configured (see [TCPIP_GET_IPINFO](#413-tcpip_get_ipinfo-get-ip-address) routine) are queried. If the
implementation supports a local hosts file or an equivalent mechanism (as indicated by
the homonym capability flag), then it is queried first, and only when no match is found is
the DNS server queried.

Strings that directly represent an IP address (for example "120.200.0.34") must also be
accepted by this routine, making then easy to develop programs that accept both host
names and IP addresses as a user supplied parameter. This functionality is mandatory
even if the implementation does not support host name resolution by local hosts file nor
by querying DNS servers (that is, even if the _"Resolve host names by querying a local
hosts file"_ and _"Resolve host names by querying a DNS server"_ capability flags are both
not set).

After the host name is examined, there are three possibilities regarding how the host
name can be resolved:

1. _The name represents an IP address._ In that case, the result is directly returned
in registers HL and DE, and B=1 is returned.
2. _The name can be resolved locally_, by using a local hosts file or the resolver
cache. In that case, the result is directly returned in registers HL and DE, and
B=2 is returned.
3. _A query to a DNS server is needed to resolve the name._ In that case, the query
is started and B=0 is immediately returned; the query processing will continue in
background. TCP_DNS_S must be invoked in order to know when the query has
finished, and to get the result.

The implementation can use the _"TCPIP_DNS_Q is a blocking operation"_ feature flag to announce that
this routine may query DNS servers and that in this case it won't return to the caller until
such process is completed or fails (thus never returning the "a query to a DNS server is in progress" state).
Client applications may use this flag to be aware that the routine may take a long time to return.

In the first two cases, the result must be cached so that a later call to [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) will
return it as well. That way, client applications may ignore the fact that some names will
be resolved locally (that is, they can ignore the returned values in B, HL and DE), and
always invoke TCP_DNS_S to get the result of the name resolution process.

As stated above, the only mandatory capability of this routine is to parse strings
representing IP addresses. Resolution of host names via local hosts file, and resolution
via queries to DNS servers, are both optional capabilities. Depending of which of these
capabilities are supported, implementations should behave as follows when a host name
that does not represent an IP address is requested to be resolved:

* _None of the capabilities is supported:_ An ERR_NOT_IMP error must be returned.
* _Only local hosts file is supported:_ The host name must be searched in the local
hosts file. If not found, a "Host name not found" error must be cached so a later
call to [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) will return it. (See the description of [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) for
details on this error)
* _Only queries to DNS servers are supported:_ A query to the configured DNS
server must be started.
* _Both capabilities are supported:_ The host name must be searched in the local
hosts file. If not found, a query to the configured DNS server must be started.

If there is already a query in progress when [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query) is executed, normally this
query will be aborted in order to initiate the new one (only one query can be handled at
a time). However, if B:2 is set at input and there is a query in progress, then this query
will not be aborted and a ERR_QUERY_EXSITS will be returned instead.

How the implementation performs queries to DNS servers is outside this specification,
however it is expected that all implementations will follow some basic procedures:

* The primary DNS server will be queried, and in case of failure, the secondary
server will be queried.
* The "recursive query" flag in the packets send to the DNS servers will be set, but
if the server does not support recursive queries and the address of another DNS
server is obtained instead of the requested IP address, then this server will in
turn be queried.
* A total timeout for the entire process will be implemented so that a client
application invoking [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) in a loop will not hang forever waiting for a
result.

However the implementation behaves, the process must be transparent for client
applications, which will rely exclusively on the results returned by [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query) and
[TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) routines.

**Note for implementors:** The following algorithm should be followed when
implementing this routine, to ensure that it behaves properly and returns the
appropriate error codes depending on the input parameters and the supported
capabilities.

```
Is B:0 set?
  Yes: Abort the current query, if any
       Return ERR_OK, B=0
Is there a query in progress?
  Yes: Is B:2 set?
    Yes: Return ERR_QUERY_EXISTS
    No: Abort the current query
Try to parse host name as an IP address
Success?
  Yes: Cache the result so that TCPIP_DNS_S will return it
       Return ERR_OK, B=1, and the address in HL,DE
B:1 was set?
  Yes: Return ERR_INV_IP
Are the local hosts file mechanism capability, and the querying DNS servers capability, both NOT supported?
  Yes: Return ERR_NOT_IMP
Is the local hosts file mechanism supported?
  Yes: Is the host name in the local hosts file?
    Yes: Cache the result so that TCPIP_DNS_S will return it
         Return ERR_OK, B=2, and the address in HL,DE
Is DNS querying supported?
  No: Cache a "Host name not found error" so that TCPIP_DNS_S will return it (see description of TCPIP_DNS_S)
      Return ERR_OK, B=0
Is DNS cache supported?
  Yes: Is the host name in the DNS cache?
    Yes: Cache the result so that TCPIP_DNS_S will return it
         Return ERR_OK, B=2, and the address in HL,DE
Is network available?
  No: Return ERR_NO_NETWORK
Is there any DNS server configured?
  No: return ERR_NO_DNS
Start querying the primary DNS server, or the secondary, if primary is not configured
Return ERR_OK, B=0
```

Please note that the result is cached only if ERR_OK is returned. If any other error code
is returned, then [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) must still return the same result as before [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query)
was invoked.

**Note for client application developers:** Below is an example of a simple way of using
the [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query)/S routines pair. For simplicity it is assumed that the implementation
routines can be called directly, without need for slot or segment switching.

```
;* Start the query

    ld   hl,HOST_NAME
    xor  a
    call TCPIP_DNS_Q
    or   a
    jp   nz,ERROR_Q ;Jump to error management code

;* Wait until either a result or an error is returned

WAIT:
    xor  a
    call TCPIP_DNS_S
    cp   1 ;Query is still in progress
    jr   z,WAIT
    cp   3 ;Query finished with error
    jp   z,ERROR_S ;Jump to error management code
    ;From here, A can only be equal to 2
    ld (IP_ADD),hl ;Store the result
    ld (IP_ADD+2),de
    ...

HOST_NAME: db "name.host.com",0
IP_ADD: ds 4
```

Note that in this example, we don't care about HOST_NAME representing an IP address
or being resolved locally. We just invoke [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) to get the resolved IP address,
without checking how it was obtained. This will be enough in most cases.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

A DNS query is in progress, or the name resolution process has finished and the result
has been cached for [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result).

* ERR_INV_PARAM

An unused flag was set in B.

* ERR_INV_IP

The host name does not represent an IP address and the routine was invoked with B:1
set.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The host name does not represent an IP address, and neither the "Resolve host names
by querying a local hosts file" nor the "Resolve host names by querying a DNS server"
capabilities are supported.

* ERR_QUERY_EXISTS

The routine was invoked with B:0 set and there is another query in progress.

* ERR_NO_NETWORK

A query to a DNS server must start, but there is no network connectivity available.

* ERR_NO_DNS

A query to a DNS server must start, but there are no DNS server addresses configured.

### 4.3.2. TCPIP_DNS_S: Obtains the host name resolution process state and result

* Input: 
  * A = 7
  * B = Flags, when set to 1 they instruct the resolver to:
    * bit 0: Clear any existing result or error condition after the execution (except if there is a query in progress)

* Output:
  * A = Error code
  * B = DNS error code (when error is ERR_DNS)
  * B = Current query status (when error is ERR_OK):
    * 0: There is no query in progress, nor any result nor error code available
    * 1: There is a query in progress
    * 2: Query is complete
  * C = Current query substatus (when error is ERR_OK and B=1):
    * 0: Unknown
    * 1: Querying the primary DNS server
    * 2: Querying the secondary DNS server
    * 3: Querying another DNS server
  * C = Resolution proces type (when error is ERR_OK and B=2):
    * 0: The name was obtained by querying a DNS server
    * 1: The name was a direct representation of an IP address
    * 2: The name was resolved locally
  * L.H.E.D = Resolved IP address (when error is ERR_OK and B=2)

This routine is the complementary of [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query). It allow to obtain the status of the
current host name resolution process (which was initiated via an invocation to
[TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query)); and if the query process has finished, it returns either the resulting IP
addres or an appropriate error code.

As explained in the description of [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query), in certain circumstances the host name
can be resolved locally, without having to actually query any DNS server. In that case,
the result is cached so that [TCPIP_DNS_S](#432-tcpip_dns_s-obtains-the-host-name-resolution-process-state-and-result) returns it as well; that way, client applications
do not need to worry about a DNS query being actually performed or not (see the
sample code in the description of [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query)).

If B:0 is set at input, the current result is cleared after the routine returns, so that a
later invocation of the routine will return B=0 (no query is in progress and no result is
available). If B:0 is not set at input, successive invocations of the routine will always
return the same result, until an invocation of [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query) that returns ERR_OK is
performed. Note that B:0 is ignored if there is a query in progress.

If ERR_DNS is returned, then B returns an error code with more detailed error
information. Below are the possible error codes that B can return; codes 1 to 15 are
directly returned by a DNS server (as defined in RFC1035), other codes are generated by
the implementation itself. Errors 1 and 4 should never be obtained if the implementation
is working properly.

* 0: Unknown error
* 1: Invalid query packet format
* 2: DNS server failure
* 3: The specified host name does not exist
* 4: The DNS server does not support this kind of query
* 5: Query refused
* 6-15: Undefined error codes
* 16: One of the queried DNS servers did not reply
* 17: Total process timeout expired
* 18: Query cancelled by the user ([TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query) was executed with B:0 set)
* 19: Network connectivity was lost during the process
* 20: The obtained reply did not contain REPLY nor AUTHORITATIVE
* 21: The obtained reply is truncated

Note that this routine does never return ERR_NOT_IMP, since it is required that
[TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query) is implemented to at least parse strings representing IP addresses.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

A DNS query is in progress, or a DNS query has finished without errors, or no query is in
progress and results from a past query are not available.

* ERR_DNS

A DNS query has finished with errors, see register B for more details.

### 4.4. UDP protocol related routines

These routines allow to send and receive data by using the UDP protocol. Even if UDP is
a datagram based, connectionless protocol, a connections-like mechanism is used; here
an "UDP connection" is simply a pair formed by the local IP address + a local port
number. When sending UDP data, the connection number and the remote IP address and
port must be specified; when a UDP datagram is received on a given connection, the
remote IP address and port are retrieved as well.

UDP connections are identified by connection numbers, which may be any number in the
range 1 to 254. The numbers actually used depend on the implementation; client
applications should handle these numbers as opaque values.

There is a "intended connection lifetime" parameter that is to be specified when opening
the connection: _transient_, which means that the connection is intended to be closed
when the client application finishes; and _resident_, which means that the connection is
intended to be used by a resident program. The only behavioral difference between
these two modes as far as this specification is concerned, is that all open transient
connections are closed when [TCPIP_UDP_CLOSE](#442-tcpip_udp_close-close-a-udp-connection) is invoked and zero is specified as the
connection number, being the resident connections unaffected.

This specification does not define how implementations should handle incoming UDP
datagrams whose destination port number is not associated with any open UDP
connection. These datagrams can be silently discarded, or implementation specific
routines can be defined to handle them.

### 4.4.1. TCPIP_UDP_OPEN: Open a UDP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 8
  * HL = Local port number (FFFFh: random port)
  * B = Intended connection lifetime:
    * 0: Transient
    * 1: Resident

* Output:
  * A = Error code
  * B = Connection number

This routine opens a new UDP connection. This process does not imply any type of
negotiation or data exchange with any remote host; all that happens is that a connection
number is associated with a local port number.

The port number should not be zero, as this means "unespecified port" in the UDP
protocol, and this is not supported by this specification. Also, it should not be in the
range FFF0h-FFFEh, these port numbers are reserved for internal use of the
implementations.

When FFFFh is specified as the port number, the implementation must use a randomly
chosen port number. This port will be in the range 16384-32767, and will never be a
port number used by another open UDP connection.

Once the connection is open, UDP datagrams data can be sent and received by using the
[TCPIP_UDP_SEND](#444-tcpip_udp_send-send-an-udp-datagram) and [TCPIP_UDP_RCV](#445-tcpip_udp_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-udp-datagram) routines. The connection can be closed by using
[TCPIP_UDP_CLOSE](#442-tcpip_udp_close-close-a-udp-connection). These routines expect the connection number returned by
[TCPIP_UDP_OPEN](#441-tcpip_udp_open-open-a-udp-connection) as an input parameter.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been created successfully. The returned connection number is valid.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open UDP connections"_ capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support sending and receiving UDP datagrams.

* ERR_INV_PARAM

  - The "intended connection lifetime" parameter has an invalid value.
  - Zero has been specified as the local port.
  - The local port is in the range FFF0h-FFFEh.

* ERR_CONN_EXISTS

Other UDP connection exists which has the same local port assigned.

* ERR_NO_FREE_CONN

There are no free UDP connections available.

### 4.4.2. TCPIP_UDP_CLOSE: Close a UDP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 9
  * B = Connection number, 0 to close all open transient UDP connections

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

This routine closes the specified UDP connection. This process does not imply any type of
negotiation or data exchange with any remote host; all that happens is that the
connection number is freed and all the pending incoming datagrams for the connection
are discarded.

All the existing connections that were open in "transient" lifetime mode are closed if zero
is specified as the connection number.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection(s) has (have) been closed successfully.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The "Open UDP connections" capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support sending and receiving UDP datagrams.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.4.3. TCPIP_UDP_STATE: Get the state of a UDP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 10
  * B = Connection number

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * HL = Local port number
  * B = Number of pending incoming datagrams
  * DE = Size of oldest pending incoming datagram (data part only)

This routine retrieves information about the UDP connection with the specified number.

_"Number of pending incoming datagrams"_ indicates how many UDP datagrams whose
destination port matches the connection's associated port have been received and
cached by the implementation; these datagrams can be retrieved by using the
[TCPIP_UDP_RCV](#445-tcpip_udp_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-udp-datagram) routine. Implementations are required to have buffer space for only one
incoming UDP datagram per connection, but may optionally have space for more.
Datagrams received when this buffer is full are silently discarded.

_"Number of pending incoming datagrams"_ may actually be smaller than the actual
number of pending datagrams, if the implementation knows than there are received
datagrams but has no means to know how many. The following rules apply: if no
pending datagrams are available, then B=0; if at least one pending datagram is
available, then B>0 but less than or equal to the number of pending datagrams.
Applications willing to retrieve all the pending datagrams for a UDP connection should
not rely on this number; instead, they should invoke [TCPIP_UDP_RCV](#445-tcpip_udp_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-udp-datagram) repeatedly until
ERR_NO_DATA is returned.

_"Size of oldest pending datagram"_ indicates the size of the data part of the datagram
that will be retrieved by the next call to [TCPIP_UDP_RCV](#445-tcpip_udp_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-udp-datagram). It is zero if the datagram
contains no data apart from the UDP header, and contains no meaningful information if
there are no pending datagrams (that is, if B=0 is returned).

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The requested information has been retrieved.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open UDP connections"_ capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support sending and receiving UDP datagrams.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.4.4. TCPIP_UDP_SEND: Send an UDP datagram

* Input:
  *  A = 11
  * B = Connection number
  * HL = Address of datagram data
  * DE = Address of parameters block

* Output:
  * A = Error code

This routine sends a block of data in the form od an UDP datagram. The local port used
to compose the datagram is the one associated to the specified connection; the remote
IP address and port are took from the parameters block. The format of the parameters
block is as follows:

* +0 (4): Destination IP address
* +4 (2): Destination port
* +6 (2): Data length

The maximum allowed value for the datagram data length is equal to the maximum
outgoing datagram size supported, minus 28 (the combined size of the IP and UDP
headers).

Implementations are expected to send the datagram immediately. At most, the routine
can block while waiting for another datagram transmission in progress to finish; or the
datagram can be cached to be sent at a later time, provided that the time between
routine invocation and actual datagram send is very small (unnoticeable for the user).

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The datagram has been sent.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The "Open UDP connections" capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support sending and receiving UDP datagrams.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

* ERR_NO_NETWORK

No network connectivity is currently available.

* ERR_LARGE_DGRAM

The data length specified in the parameters block is larger than the maximum outgoing
datagram size supported minus 28.

### 4.4.5. TCPIP_UDP_RCV: Retrieve an incoming UDP datagram

* Input: 
  * A = 12
  * B = Connection number
  * HL = Address for datagram data
  * DE = Maximum data size to retrieve

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * L.H.E.D = Source IP address
  * IX = Source port
  * BC = Actual received data size

This routine retrieves the data part and information parameters of the oldest received
UDP datagram for the given connection, and removes the datagram from the
implementation's internal buffer. Implementations are required to have buffer space for
only one incoming UDP datagram per connection, but may optionally have space for
more. Datagrams received when this buffer is full are silently discarded.

The data part of the datagram, without the IP and UDP headers, will be copied to the
address pointed by HL. The entire datagram data part will be copied if its length is
smaller or equal than the "maximum data size" parameter passed in DE; otherwise, only
the first DE bytes will be copied and the rest of the datagram data will be discarded
(DE=FFFFh can be specified with the meaning of "get the whole datagram"). No data
will be copied at all if DE=0. Remember that it is possible to check the datagram data
size in advance by using [TCPIP_UDP_STATE](#443-tcpip_udp_state-get-the-state-of-a-udp-connection).

Information about the originator of the datagram will be returned in registers HL, DE,
and IX. Register BC will contain the datagram data size as it was received, which may be
larger than the number of bytes actually retrieved.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The datagram data and information have been retrieved.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open UDP connections"_ capability flag is not set. The implementation does not
support sending and receiving UDP datagrams.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

* ERR_NO_DATA

There are no pending incoming datagrams for the specified connection.

### 4.5. TCP protocol related routines

These routines allow to send and receive data by using the TCP protocol. TCP is a
connection based protocol, and thus this specification defines TCP connections as the
way to manage TCP communications. A connection is defined by two pairs of IP address + port,
one for the local computer and another one for the remote computer.

TCP connections are identified by connection numbers, which may be any number in the
range 1 to 254. The numbers actually used depend on the implementation; client
applications should handle these numbers as opaque values.

There is a "intended connection lifetime" parameter that is to be specified when opening
the connection: _transient_, which means that the connection is intended to be closed
when the client application finishes; and _resident_, which means that the connection is
intended to be used by a resident program. The only behavioral difference between
these two modes as far as this specification is concerned, is that all open transient
connections are closed when [TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE](#452-tcpip_tcp_close-close-a-tcp-connection) is invoked and zero is specified as the
connection number, being the resident connections unaffected. The same applies to
[TCPIP_TCP_ABORT](#453-tcpip_tcp_abort-abort-a-tcp-connection).

### 4.5.1. TCPIP_TCP_OPEN: Open a TCP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 13
  * HL = Address of parameters block

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * B = Connection number

This routine opens a new TCP connection using the information specified in the
parameters block. The format of this block is:

* +0 (4): Remote IP address (0.0.0.0 for unespecified remote socket)
* +4 (2): Remote port (ignored if unespecified remote socket)
* +6 (2): Local port, FFFFh for a random value
* +8 (2): Suggestion for user timeout value
* +10 (1): Flags:
  * bit 0: Set for passive connection
  * bit 1: Set for resident connection
  * bit 2: Use TLS
  * bit 3: Verify the server certificate (only when using TLS on an active connection)
  * bits 4-7: Unused, must be zero
* +11 (2): Address of the server host name for certificate validation,
or zero to skip host name validation (only when using TLS on an active connection and 
"Verify the server certificate" is set)

If the connection is open in active mode, a remote IP address and a remote port must be
specified. The implementation must start trying to actively establish a connection (that
is, a SYN segment must be sent and connection must enter the SYN-SENT state), and
must continue processing the connection establishment in background.

If the connection is open in passive mode, there is the option to leave the remote IP
address unespecified (by specifying it as 0.0.0.0), meaning that a connection from any
host will be accepted; the remote port is ignored in this case. The implementation must
simply enter the LISTEN state when a connection is open in passive mode.

Only one connection can exist with the same combination of local port, remote IP
address and remote port. Passive connections with unespecified remote socket are an
exception: more than one connection can exist with the same local port and 0.0.0.0 as
the remote IP address. In this case, when a connection request is received for that local
port, the implementation must choose one of these connections, and there is no way for
client applications to decide which one is chosen.

When FFFFh is specified as the local port, the implementation must use a randomly
chosen port number. This port will be in the range 16384-32767, and will never be a
port number used by another open TCP connection.

Although the TCP standard allows to transform a passive connection into an active one
by opening it again, this is not allowed in this specification. On the other hand, sending
data to an active connection before it reaches the ESTABLISHED state may or may not
be supported by the implementation, depending on the value of the "Send data to a TCP
connection before the ESTABLISHED state is reached" capability flag. When this is
supported, data is cached internally by the implementation, and then sent when the
ESTABLISHED state is reached.

The "user timeout" is a suggested value for a timer that is activated when new data is
sent to the connection, and is stopped when the acknowledgment (ACK) arrives for that
data. If this timer expires, the host is considered to be unreachable and the connection
is aborted. This timer is also applied to the connection initiation (that is, it is also the
maximum time that can elapse until the acknowledgment for a sent SYN segment
arrives). The specified value is interpreted as follows:

* 1 to 1080: Value for the timer in seconds (1 second to 18 minutes).
* 0: Use the default value for the timer, as chosen by the implementation.
* FFFFh: Infinite, data is retransmitted indefinitely until either the
acknowledgment arrives, the connection is aborted or an RST segment arrives.

Note that this value is just a suggestion: implementations may ignore it and use their
own value, or they may not implement this timeout at all.

Once the connection is open, TCP data can be sent and received by using the
[TCPIP_TCP_SEND](#455-tcpip_tcp_send-send-data-a-tcp-connection) and [TCPIP_TCP_RCV](#456-tcpip_tcp_rcv-receive-data-from-a-tcp-connection) routines. The connection can be closed by using
[TCPIP_UDP_CLOSE](#442-tcpip_udp_close-close-a-udp-connection), or aborted by using [TCPIP_TCP_ABORT](#453-tcpip_tcp_abort-abort-a-tcp-connection). These routines expect the
connection number returned by [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection) as an input parameter.

The implementation may use the _"TCPIP_TCP_OPEN is a blocking operation"_ to announce that
the routine will go throught the entire connection process synchronously, and will not return
until either the connection is completed (the ESTABLISHED or the CLOSE_WAIT state is reached)
or fails. Client applications may use this flag to be aware that the routine may take a long time to return.

**Note for client application developers:** The usual procedure after opening an active connection
is to enter a loop to wait while the connection is being established (while the connection status
returned by [TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection) is either 
SYN-SEND or SYN-RECEIVED). When entering such a loop
it's important to take in account that the server might send data and close the connection 
very quickly, thus progressing to the CLOSE_WAIT state and not giving TCPIP_TCP_STATE the opportunity to
ever return ESTABLISHED as the state of the connection. Therefore, applications should NOT
assume that TCPIP_TCP_STATE will eventually return ESTABLISHED as the state of the connection;
they should check for CLOSE_WAIT as well (or even better, for robustness they should detect any
unexpected state and abort the connection).

#### About TLS support

**Note:** TLS support was introduced in version 1.1 of the specification. Implementations of version
1.0 don't provide any support for TLS and will always ignore the "Verify the server certificate" flag and
the "Address of the server host name for certificate validation" field in the parameters block.

When the "Use TLS" flag is not set in the connection parameters block, the connection
must be done without using TLS. When the flag is set there are the following possibilities:

* The connection is active

  * "Verify the server certificate" flag is not set: the implementation must not
  perform any kind of validation for the certificate provided by the server.

  * "Verify the server certificate" flag is not set and "Address of the server host name for certificate validation"
  is non-zero: the validity of the certificate provided by the server must be verified, and if there is any error, then the connection must be closed immediately. As part of the validation, the host name in the certificate must be compared
  against the host name supplied in the parameters block; if they aren't identical the certificate is considered
  to be invalid.
  
   * "Verify the server certificate" flag is not set and "Address of the server host name for certificate validation"
  is zero: the validity of the certificate provided by the server must be verified, and if there is any error, then the connection must be closed immediately. However the host name in the certificate must be ignored.

* The connection is passive

  * The implementation must provide a valid certificate to be checked by the client that
  initiated the connection.

If the _The server certificate can be verified when opening a TCP connection with TLS_ feature flag
is not set, then the server certificate is never verified and the implementation always ignores
the value of the "Verify the server certificate" flag of the connection parameters block, acting as if it was zero.

If the connection needs to be closed due to a TLS related error, it's strongly recommended to provide
a meaningful code in the "Close reason" field when [TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection)
is executed for the connection.

In order to properly handle TLS the implementation will need to store and handle certificates and private keys.
How this is done is outside the scope of this specification.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been open with the specified parameters. The returned connection
number is valid.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

  - The connection is required to be open in active mode, but the _"Open TCP connections
in active mode"_ capability flag is not set.
  - The connection is required to be open in passive mode with specified remote socker,
but the _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified remote socket"_ capability
flag is not set.
  - The connection is required to be open in passive mode with unespecified remote
socker, but the _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket"_ capability flag is not set.
  - The connection is required to be active and to use TLS, but the
 _"Use TLS in TCP active connections"_ capability flag is not set.
  - The connection is required to be passive and to use TLS, but the
 _"Use TLS in TCP passive connections"_ capability flag is not set.

* ERR_INV_PARAM

  - An invalid value for the user timeout was specified.
  - 0.0.0.0 was specified as the remote IP address when trying to open a connection in
active mode.
  - An unused flag was set.

* ERR_NO_NETWORK

No network connectivity is currently available.

* ERR_CONN_EXISTS

There is a TCP connection already open with the same combination of local port, remote
IP address and remote port.

* ERR_NO_FREE_CONN

There are no free TCP connections available.

* ERR_NO_CONN

The _"TCPIP_TCP_OPEN is a blocking operation"_ feature flag is set and it wasn't possible
to complete the connection failed.

### 4.5.2. TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE: Close a TCP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 14
  * B = Connection number, 0 to close all open transient TCP connections

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

This routine initiates the closing procedure for a TCP connection. As per the TCP protocol,
closing a connection implies that it is not possible to send new data to it, but the other
side can still sending new data (and we can still receiving it); the connection will not be
freed until both sides have exchanged a FIN segment. To immediately destroy the
connection, [TCPIP_TCP_ABORT](#453-tcpip_tcp_abort-abort-a-tcp-connection) should be used instead.

All the existing connections that were open in "transient" lifetime mode are closed if zero
is specified as the connection number.

After a connection is explicitly closed with this routine the implementation may discard any
incoming data that hasn't yet been consumed by client applications.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been closed.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The implementation does not support TCP connections at all (none of the _"Open TCP
connections in active mode"_, _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified
remote socket"_ or _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket"_ capability flags is set).

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.5.3. TCPIP_TCP_ABORT: Abort a TCP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 15
  * B = Connection number, 0 to abort all open transient TCP connections

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

This routine aborts the TCP connection with the specified number. An RST segment is
sent if appropriate (according to the TCP protocol specification), and then the connection
is freed immediately.

All the existing connections that were open in "transient" lifetime mode are aborted if
zero is specified as the connection number.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been aborted.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The implementation does not support TCP connections at all (none of the _"Open TCP
connections in active mode"_, _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified
remote socket"_ or _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket"_ capability flags is set).

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.5.4. TCPIP_TCP_STATE: Get the state of a TCP connection

* Input:
  * A = 16
  * B = Connection number
  * HL = Pointer in TPA for connection information block (0 if not needed)

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * B = Connection state
  * C = Connection flags (if the connection exists and is in the ESTABLISHED or CLOSE_WAIT state)
  * C = Close reason (if the connection doesn't exist)
  * HL = Number of total available incoming bytes
  * DE = Number of urgent available incoming bytes
  * IX = Available free space in the output buffer (FFFFh = infinite)

This routine returns information about the current state of an open TCP connection. It is
useful mainly to know if data can be sent to the connection, and if so how many output
buffer space is available; as well as to know if incoming data is available.

The connection information block is 8 bytes long. If a non-zero pointer is passed in HL,
and if no error is returned, it will be filled with the following information about the
connection:

* +0 (4): Remote IP address
* +4 (2): Remote port
* +6 (2): Local port

The **connection state** value encodes the current connection state as defined in the TCP
specification. It will be one of the following values:

* 0: Unknown
* 1: LISTEN
* 2: SYN-SENT
* 3: SYN-RECEIVED
* 4: ESTABLISHED
* 5: FIN-WAIT-1
* 6: FIN-WAIT-2
* 7: CLOSE-WAIT
* 8: CLOSING
* 9: LAST-ACK
* 10: TIME-WAIT

If the connection uses TLS the implementation must not return ESTABLISHED as the state
of the connection before the TLS handshake has finished and all the involved certificates
have been verified; SYN-SENT (for active connections) or SYN-RECEIVED (for passive connections)
should be returned instead.

The **connection flags** value is returned onlye when the connection exists
(no error is returned in A) and is in the ESTABLISHED or CLOSE_WAIT state,
and contains the following information:

* Bit 0: The connection uses TLS
* Bits 1-7: Unused, always zero

The **close reason** value is meaningful only when ERR_NO_CONN is returned in A, and
contains an optional indication of why the connection is closed. It may be one of the
following values ("Unknown" should be returned if the implementation does not support
reporting close reasons):

* 0: Unknown
* 1: This connection has never been used since the implementation was initialized.
* 2: The [TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE](#452-tcpip_tcp_close-close-a-tcp-connection) method was called.
* 3: The [TCPIP_TCP_ABORT](#453-tcpip_tcp_abort-abort-a-tcp-connection) method was called.
* 4: A RST segment was received (the connection was refused or aborted by the remote host).
* 5: The user timeout expired.
* 6: The connection establishment timeout expired.
* 7: Network connection was lost while the TCP connection was open.
* 8: ICMP "Destination unreachable" message received.
* 9: TLS: The server did not provide a certificate.
* 10: TLS: Invalid server certificate.
* 11: TLS: Invalid server certificate (the host name didn't match the name provided in the parameters block when opening the connection).
* 12: TLS: Invalid server certificate (expired).
* 13: TLS: Invalid server certificate (self-signed).
* 14: TLS: Invalid server certificate (untrusted root).
* 15: TLS: Invalid server certificate (revoked).
* 16: TLS: Invalid server certificate (invalid certificate authority).
* 17: TLS: Invalid server certificate (invalid TLS version or cypher suite).
* 18: TLS: Our certificate was rejected by the peer.
* 19: TLS: Other error.
* 20-127: Reserved for future versions of the specification.
* 128-255: Implementation specific reasons.

The 128-255 range is for implementation specific reasons, implementations are free to return these with any meaning
if none of the standard codes is appropriate for a given close reason.

The **Number of total available incoming bytes** value indicates how many bytes have
been received by this connection and can be retrieved by using the [TCPIP_TCP_RCV](#456-tcpip_tcp_rcv-receive-data-from-a-tcp-connection)
routine. The **Number of urgent available incoming bytes** value indicates how many
of these bytes are urgent data (this value will always be zero if the implementation does
not support TCP urgent data, as per the "Send and receive TCP urgent data" capability
flag).

The **Available free space in the output buffer** value indicates how many data can be
queued by calling the [TCPIP_TCP_SEND](#455-tcpip_tcp_send-send-data-a-tcp-connection) routine. This free space decreases when a call to
that routine is made, and increases when the buffered data is sent an acknowledged. A
value of FFFFh means that there is no practical buffer space limit and a call to
[TCPIP_TCP_SEND](#455-tcpip_tcp_send-send-data-a-tcp-connection) will never return an ERR_BUFFER error.

**Note for implementation developers:**: As stated in the description of [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection), 
client applications should not assume that TCPIP_TCP_STATE will ever report the ESTABLISHED state (it could report CLOSE_WAIT on the first
call after opening the connection if the server sends data and then closes the connection fast enough).
However, for robustness it is recommended that implementations return ESTABLISHED as the current state of the
connection when the actual state is CLOSE_WAIT but there's still incoming data that hasn't been yet consumed
by the application.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been aborted.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The implementation does not support TCP connections at all (none of the "Open TCP
connections in active mode", "Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified
remote socket" or "Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket" capability flags is set).

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.5.5. TCPIP_TCP_SEND: Send data a TCP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 17
  * B = Connection number
  * DE = Address of the data to be sent
  * HL = Length of the data to be sent
  * C = Flags:
    * bit 0: Send the data PUSHed
    * bit 1: The data is urgent

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

This routine enqueues data to be sent by a TCP connection. The data is sent in the form
of TCP segments at the appropriate times, depending on the sending window available,
the data acknoledgements received from the remote host, and the possible data sending
optimization algorithms used by the implementation (see the TCP protocol specification
for more details).

All implementations must accept data to be enqueued when the connection is in the
ESTABLISHED or CLOSE-WAIT state. Optionally, implementations may accept also data
when the connection is in the SYN-SENT or SYN-RECEIVED state (the _"Send data to a
TCP connection before the ESTABLISHED state is reached"_ capability flag must be set);
in this case, enqueued data is sent as soon as the ESTABLISHED state is set. In all other
connection states, this routine must return a ERR_CONN_STATE error.

Implementations will tipically have a limited buffer space to enqueue TCP outgoing data.
The free space on this buffer can be checked by invoking the [TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection) routine.
Trying to enqueue more data than buffer space available will result on a ERR_BUFFER
error being returned. All implementations are required to have at least 512 bytes of TCP
output buffer space.

If the _"Explicitly set the PUSH bit when sending TCP data"_ capability flag is set, it is
possible to indicate that the data is intended to be PUSHed; in this case, the data
enqueued by the involved call and any other data previously enqueued is sent
immediately (bypassing any possible data grouping algorithm being used), and the PUSH
bit is set on the outgoing datagrams for this data. If the capability is not supported, the
PUSH flag is ignored.

Invoking this routine with HL=0 is allowed and must not result in any error
(if the specified connection is valid). If the "Send the data PUSHed" flag is set and the
capability is implemented, then this causes all the enqueued data to be
sent immediately; otherwise, nothing is done.

If the _"Send and receive TCP urgent data"_ capability flag is set, then all the data
enqueued by the involved call will be set in segments with the URG bit set. If the
capability is not supported, the "urgent data" flag is ignored.

**Note for client application developers:** The following pseudocode shows the
recommended approach for sending data to a TCP connection. The idea is to feed the
connection with data until the output buffer space is full (which is signaled by
ERR_BUFFER), and then to give the implementation an opportunity to send the data and
free the buffer (which is achieved by calling [TCPIP_WAIT](#481-tcpip_wait-wait-for-a-processing-step-to-run)_INT). BlockSize can be any
value between 1 and 512. A, B, DE and HL refer to the Z80 registers.

```
BlockSize = 128
RemainigSize = (amount of data to send)
DataAddress = (address of data to send)

do
  do
    B = ConnectionNumber
    DE = DataAddress
    HL = min(RemainingSize, BlockSize)
    call TCPIP_TCP_SEND
    error = A
    if(error = ERR_BUFFER)
      call TCPIP_WAIT
  while(error = ERR_BUFFER)

  RemainigSize = RemainingSize - HL
  DataAddress = DataAddress + HL
while(RemainingSize > 0 and error != 0)

if(error != 0)
  ProcessError(error)
```

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The data has been successfully enqueued for sending.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The implementation does not support TCP connections at all (none of the _"Open TCP
connections in active mode"_, _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified
remote socket"_ or _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket"_ capability flags is set).

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

* ERR_INV_PARAM

An unused bit was set in the flags byte.

* ERR_CONN_STATE

  - The connection is in the SYN-SENT or SYN-RECEIVED state, and the "Send data to a
TCP connection before the ESTABLISHED state is reached" capability flag is not set.
  - The connection is in the LISTEN, FIN-WAIT-1, FIN-WAIT-2, CLOSING, LAST-ACK or
TIME-WAIT state.

* ERR_BUFFER

There is not enough free output buffer to enqueue all the specified data.

### 4.5.6. TCPIP_TCP_RCV: Receive data from a TCP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 18
  * B = Connection number
  * DE = Address for the retrieved data
  * HL = Length of the data to be obtained

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * BC = Total number of bytes that have been actually retrieved
  * HL = Number of urgent data bytes that have been retrieved (placed at the beginning of the received data block)

This routine copies to the specified address as much enqueued incoming data bytes as
specified in the HL register. If there is less data available, then all the available data is
retrieved, and if no data is available at all, then no data is retrieved; in any case, the
number of bytes actually retrieved is returned in BC. Having retrieved less data than
requested or having retrieved no data at all is not considered an error.

It is possible to check how many incoming data bytes are available by invoking the
[TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection) routine, but this is not mandatory since as mentioned above, trying
to get more data than available is allowed.

If the _"Send and receive TCP urgent data"_ capability flag is set, then it is possible than
part of the received data is urgent. In that case, the urgent data is placed at the
beginning of the retrieved data block, and a value will be returned in HL telling how
many of the retrieved bytes are urgent. HL will be zero if no urgent data has been
received, or if receiving urgent data is not supported by the implementation.

Note that unlike when sending TCP data, it is not necessray for client applications to
worry about the implementation's buffer space for incoming data to be exhausted, since
this is handled by the TCP protocol itself (if the buffer is full, the implementation will
simply close the receiving window and the remote host will not send more data). Also,
this routine can be safely called regardless of the state the TCP connection is in; if the
current state does not allow receiving data, then simply no data will be retrieved at all
and BC will be returned as zero.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The data has been successfully retrieved.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The implementation does not support TCP connections at all (none of the _"Open TCP
connections in active mode"_, _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified
remote socket"_ or _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket"_ capability flags is set).

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.5.7. TCPIP_TCP_DISCARD: Discard data in the output buffer of a TCP connection

* Input:
  * A = 19
  * B = Connection number

* Output:
  * A = Error code

This routine discards all data in the output buffer of a TCP connection, that is, removes from the
appropriate output buffer the data that has been enqueued to be sent by
[TCPIP_TCP_SEND](#455-tcpip_tcp_send-send-data-a-tcp-connection) but has not been sent yet.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The data has been successfully retrieved.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

  - The implementation does not support TCP connections at all (none of the _"Open TCP
connections in active mode"_, _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with specified
remote socket"_ or _"Open TCP connections in passive mode, with unespecified remote
socket"_ capability flags is set).
  - The "Discard data in the output buffer of a TCP connection" capability flag is not set.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.6. Raw IP connections related routines

These routines allow to send and receive data by using a transport protocol which is not
TCP nor UDP. This is achieved by opening a raw IP connection for a given protocol code.
When sending data, the implementation will add a IP header with the given protocol
code and the specified destination IP address to the supplied block of data, and the
result will be sent as a IP datagram; receiving data works by the implementation
capturing and enqueueing all incoming datagrams having the given protocol specified in
the IP header, and returning them when the client application requests them.

Raw IP connections are identified by connection numbers, which may be any number in
the range 1 to 254. The numbers actually used depend on the implementation; client
applications should handle these numbers as opaque values.

There is a "intended connection lifetime" parameter that is to be specified when opening
the connection: _transient_, which means that the connection is intended to be closed
when the client application finishes; and _resident_, which means that the connection is
intended to be used by a resident program. The only behavioral difference between
these two modes as far as this specification is concerned, is that all open transient
connections are closed when [TCPIP_RAW_CLOSE](#462-tcpip_raw_close-close-a-raw-ip-connection) is invoked and zero is specified as the
connection number, being the resident connections unaffected.

### 4.6.1. TCPIP_RAW_OPEN: Open a raw IP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 20
  * B = Transport protocol code
  * C = Intended connection lifetime:
    * 0: Transient
    * 1: Resident

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * B = Connection number

This routine opens a raw IP connection for the specified transport protocol code. This
process does not imply any type of negotiation or data exchange with any remote host;
all that happens is that a connection number is associated with the protocol code.

While the connection is open, the implementation will capture and enqueue all the
incoming datagrams that have the specified value in the protocol field; the client
application can retrieve them by using the [TCPIP_RAW_RCV](#465-tcpip_raw_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-raw-ip-datagram) routine. Also, it is possible
to send datagrams which will have the specified value in the protocol field of the IP
header by using the [TCPIP_RAW_SEND](#464-tcpip_raw_send-send-a-raw-ip-datagram) routine, and to close the connection by using
[TCPIP_RAW_CLOSE](#462-tcpip_raw_close-close-a-raw-ip-connection). These routines expect the connection number returned by
[TCPIP_RAW_OPEN](#461-tcpip_raw_open-open-a-raw-ip-connection) as an input parameter.

If the transport protocol code for TCP, UDP or ICMP is specified, the implementation
behavior is undefined. It could capture only the packets that are not associated to any
open TCP or UDP connection, or it could effetively capture all the incoming datagrams for
the specified protocol and render all open connections for that protocol useless.
It is not possible to open more than one connection for the same protocol code.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been successfully open. The returned connection number is valid.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open raw IP connections"_ capability flags is not set. The implementation does not
support raw IP connections.

* ERR_CONN_EXISTS

A raw IP connection for the specified protocol already exists.

* ERR_NO_FREE_CONN

There are no free raw IP connections available.

### 4.6.2. TCPIP_RAW_CLOSE: Close a raw IP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 21
  * B = Connection number, 0 to close all open transient UDP connections

* Output: A = Error code

This routine closes the specified raw IP connection. This process does not imply any type
of negotiation or data exchange with any remote host; all that happens is that the
connection number is freed and all the pending incoming datagrams for the connection
are discarded. Also, the implementation will stop capturing datagrams with the protocol
number associated to the connection in the IP header.

All the existing connections that were open in "transient" lifetime mode are closed if zero
is specified as the connection number.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The connection has been closed successfully.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open raw IP connections"_ capability flags is not set. The implementation does not
support raw IP connections.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.6.3. TCPIP_RAW_STATE: Get the state of a raw IP connection

* Input: 
  * A = 22
  * B = Connection number

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * B = Associated protocol code
  * HL = Number of pending incoming datagrams
  * DE = Size of the oldest pending incoming datagram

This routine retrieves information about the raw connection with the specified number.

_"Number of pending incoming datagrams"_ indicates how many datagrams whose
protocol code in the IP header matches the connection's associated protocol code have
been received and cached by the implementation; these datagrams can be retrieved by
using the [TCPIP_RAW_RCV](#465-tcpip_raw_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-raw-ip-datagram) routine. Implementations are required to have buffer space
for only one incoming IP datagram per connection, but may optionally have space for
more. Datagrams received when this buffer is full are silently discarded.

_"Size of oldest pending datagram"_ indicates the size of the data part of the datagram
that will be retrieved by the next call to [TCPIP_RAW_RCV](#465-tcpip_raw_rcv-retrieve-an-incoming-raw-ip-datagram). It is zero if the datagram
contains no data apart from the IP header itself, and contains no meaningful information
if there are no pending datagrams (that is, if B=0 is returned).

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The requested information has been retrieved.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open raw IP connections"_ capability flags is not set. The implementation does not
support raw IP connections.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

### 4.6.4. TCPIP_RAW_SEND: Send a raw IP datagram

* Input:
  * A = 23
  * B = Connection number
  * HL = Address of datagram data
  * DE = Address of parameters block

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

This routine sends a block of data in the form of an IP datagram. The implementation
will prepend the passed data block with a IP header composed from the protocol code
associated to the connection and the data in the parameters block. The format of the
parameters block is as follows:

* +0 (4): Destination IP address
* +4 (2): Data length

The maximum allowed value for the datagram data length is equal to the maximum
outgoing datagram size supported, minus 20 (the size of the IP header).

Implementations are expected to send the datagram immediately. At most, the routine
can block while waiting for another datagram transmission in progress to finish; or the
datagram can be cached to be sent at a later time, provided that the time between
routine invocation and actual datagram send is very small (unnoticeable for the user).

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The datagram has been sent.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open raw IP connections"_ capability flags is not set. The implementation does not
support raw IP connections.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

* ERR_NO_NETWORK

No network connectivity is currently available.

* ERR_LARGE_DGRAM

The data length specified in the parameters block is larger than the maximum outgoing
datagram size supported minus 20.

### 4.6.5. TCPIP_RAW_RCV: Retrieve an incoming raw IP datagram

* Input: 
  * A = 24
  * B = Connection number
  * HL = Address for datagram data
  * DE = Maximum data size to retrieve

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * L.H.E.D = Source IP address
  * BC = Actual received data size

This routine retrieves the data part and information parameters of the oldest received IP
datagram for the given connection, and removes the datagram from the
implementation's internal buffer. Implementations are required to have buffer space for
only one incoming IP datagram per connection, but may optionally have space for more.
Datagrams received when this buffer is full are silently discarded.

The data part of the datagram, without the IP header, will be copied to the address
pointed by HL. The entire datagram data part will be copied if its length is smaller or
equal than the "maximum data size" parameter passed in DE; otherwise, only the first
DE bytes will be copied and the rest of the datagram data will be discarded (DE=FFFFh
can be specified with the meaning of "get the whole datagram"). No data will be copied
at all if DE=0. Remember that it is possible to check the datagram data size in advance
by using [TCPIP_RAW_STATE](#463-tcpip_raw_state-get-the-state-of-a-raw-ip-connection).

Information about the originator of the datagram will be returned in registers HL and DE.
Register BC will contain the datagram data size as it was received, which may be larger
than the number of bytes actually retrieved.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The datagram data and information has been retrieved.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The _"Open raw IP connections"_ capability flags is not set. The implementation does not
support raw IP connections.

* ERR_NO_CONN

There is no connection open with the specified number.

* ERR_NO_DATA

There are no pending incoming datagrams for the specified connection.

### 4.7. Configuration related routines

These routines allow to configure various working parameters of the implementation.

### 4.7.1. TCPIP_CONFIG_AUTOIP: Enable or disable the automatic IP addresses retrieval

* Input: 
  * A = 25
  * B = action to perform:
    * 0: Get current configuration
    * 1: Set configuration
  * C = Configuration to set (only if B=1):
    * bit 0: Set to automatically retrieve local IP address, subnet mask and default gateway
    * bit 1: Set to automatically retrieve DNS servers addresses
    * bits 2-7: Unused, must be zero

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * C = Configuration after the routine execution (same format as C at input)

This routine configures how the various IP addresses used by the system should be
obtained. Two groups of addresses can be configured sepparately: the first group is
composed of the local IP address, the subnet mask and the default gateway address (the
latter two are ignored when they make no sense for the implementation, for example in
case of a PPP link); the second group is composed of the primary and secondary DNS
server addresses.

This routine is intended to be called in two scenarios:

- To set "automatic" when the current setting is "manual" and all the involved addresses
are 0.0.0.0. In this case, the implementation must try to automatically obtain the
addresses from a remote source (tipically a DHCP server); in case of failure in this
procedure, the involved addresses must remain to 0.0.0.0. The implementation should
retry the address retrieval procedure a reasonable number of times because giving out in
case of failure.
- To set "manual" when the current setting is "automatic" and no IP addresses have
been obatined yet (that is, the involved addresses are still 0.0.0.0).

Behavior in other cases in undefined. In particular:

- When changing from "manual" to "automatic" and the involved IP addresses already
have a value, the implementation may either discard the addresses values and start the
address retrieval procedure, or use the already configured addresses as if they were
obtained automatically.
- When changing from "automatic" to "manual" and the involved IP addresses already
have a value, the implementation may either maintain the obtained addresses or reset
them to 0.0.0.0.

Addresses on a group not set to automatic retrieving are expected to be manually set by
the user, by using the [TCPIP_CONFIG_IP](#472-tcpip_config_ip-manually-configure-an-ip-address)S routine, 
after the implementation is installed/initialized; otherwise they will remain with the value 0.0.0.0 indefinitely.

Implementations supporting automatic address retrieval should default to automatically
retrieve all addresses when installed/initialized.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The setting has been successfully changed or the current setting has been returned.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

  * B=1 and C:0 is set, but the _"Automatically obtain the local IP address, subnet mask and default gateway,
    by using DHCP or an equivalent protocol"_ capability flag is not set. The
    implementation does not support automatical retrieval of these addresses.

  * B=1 and C:1 is set, but the _"Automatically obtain the IP addresses of the DNS servers,
    by using DHCP or an equivalent protocol"_ capability flag is not set. The
    implementation does not support automatical retrieval of these addresses.

* ERR_INV_PAR

An invalid value for B or C has been specified at input.

### 4.7.2. TCPIP_CONFIG_IP: Manually configure an IP address

* Input: 
  * A = 26
  * B = Index of address to set:
    * 1: Local IP address
    * 2: Peer IP address
    * 3: Subnet mask
    * 4: Default gateway
    * 5: Primary DNS server IP address
    * 6: Secondary DNS server IP address
  * L.H.E.D = Address value

* Output:
  * A = Error code

This routine allows to manually set the value of one of the IP addresses used by the
system. The addresses group of the involved address should have been previously
configured as "manual setting" (see [TCPIP_CONFIG_AUTOIP](#471-tcpip_config_autoip-enable-or-disable-the-automatic-ip-addresses-retrieval) routine),
otherwise the behavior is undefined.

The addresses are supplied in the format L.H.E.D. For example, 1.2.3.4 would be
specified as HL=0201h, DE=0403h.

All addresses should default to 0.0.0.0 when the implementation is installed/initialized,
unless the implementation installer provides a mechanism to explicitly set the IP
addresses at install time.

This routine is intended to be invoked when the address is configured for manual setting
(see the [TCPIP_CONFIG_AUTOIP](#471-tcpip_config_autoip-enable-or-disable-the-automatic-ip-addresses-retrieval) routine).
If invoked then the address is configured for
automatic retrieval, the behavior is undefined: the implementation may either replace
the obtained address with the one supplied, or may simply ignore the routine call and
preserve the previous address.

Note that it is possible for an address to not being configurable neither manually with this routine
nor automatically via DCHP or a similar mechanism (see [TCPIP_CONFIG_AUTOIP](#471-tcpip_config_autoip-enable-or-disable-the-automatic-ip-addresses-retrieval)).
In this case the implementation decides by itself the value of that address at install time,
and from the point of view of client applications it's a hardcoded address.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The address has been successfully set.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

The associated _"Manually set the ... IP address"_ capability flag is not set.
The implementation does not support automatical retrieval of the specified address.

* ERR_INV_PAR

An invalid value for B has been specified at input, or the specified address type does not
make sense for the implementation (for example the subnet mask or the default
gateway when the link layer protocol is PPP, or the peer address on an Ethernet
network).

### 4.7.3. TCPIP_CONFIG_TTL: Get/set the value of TTL and TOS for outgoing datagrams

* Input: 
  * A = 27
  * B = Action to perform:
    * 0: Get current values
    * 1: Set values
  * D = New value for TTL (only if B=1)
  * E = New value for ToS (only if B=1)

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * D = Value of TTL after the routine execution
  * E = Value of ToS after the routine execution

This routine gets or sets the value of the TTL (Time to live) and ToS (Type of service)
that are used by the implementation for all the outgoing datagrams. These values apply
to all datagrams, it is not possible to set the value per datagram, per connection or per
protocol.

It is not possible to change only the TTL or only the ToS. If only one of the values is to
be changed, then the routine must be called with B=0, the desired value must be
changed (D or E), and then the routine must be called with B=1.

Implementations should default to TTL=64 and ToS=0 when installed/initialized whenever possible.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The values have been successfully set or obtained.

* ERR_INV_PAR

An invalid value for B has been specified at input.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

  * B=0 at input but the _"Get the TTL and ToS used for outgoing datagrams"_ capability flag is not set.
    The implementation does not support reading these values.

  * B=1 at input but the _"Explicitly set the TTL and ToS for outgoing datagrams"_ capability
    flags is not set. The implementation does not support explicitly setting these values.

### 4.7.4. TCPIP_CONFIG_PING: Get/set the automatic PING reply flag

* Input: 
  * A = 28
  * B = Action to perform:
    * 0: Get current flag value
    * 1: Set flag value
  * C = New flag value (only if B=1):
    * 0: Off
    * 1: On

* Output: 
  * A = Error code
  * C = Flag value after the routine execution

This routine gets or sets the value of the automatic PING reply flag. When it is ON, ICMP
echo request messages (PING requests) received by the implementation are
automatically replied (an ICMP echo reply message is sent in response, immediately or
as soon as possible). When it is OFF, ICMP echo request messages received are ignored.

If this flag cannot be changed by the user (because PING requests are always replied or
always ignored), this routine must return ERR_NOT_IMP when invoked with B=1, but
must still return the appropriate flag value when invoked with B=0.

The value of this flag should default to ON (if supported) when the implementation is
installed/initialized.

**ERROR CODES**

* ERR_OK

The flag value has been successfully set or obtained.

* ERR_NOT_IMP

B=1 at input but the _"Explicitly set the automatic reply to PINGs on or off"_ capability
flags is not set. The implementation does not support explicitly changing the flag value.

* ERR_INV_PAR

An invalid value for B or C has been specified at input.

### 4.8. Miscellaneous routines

These routines perform various tasks on the implementation.

### 4.8.1. TCPIP_WAIT: Wait for a processing step to run

* Input: 
  * A = 29

* Output: 
  * A = Error code

Implementations of the TCP/IP UNAPI specification are expected to be resident
programs, that is, software that runs in background, aside from the user's code running
in foreground.

Usually, and especially for implementations which are not assisted by external hardware,
the "run in background" behavior is achieved by hooking to the standard 50 or 60Hz
timer interrup available on the MSX system. The TCP/IP processing (retrieving
datagrams, processing them, sending new datagrams, updating timers, and so on) is
then done in "processing steps", one per timer interrupt, in which a series of operations
are performed depending on the available incoming datagrams and the state of timers
and other internal variables.

Since the timer interrupts may happen at any moment, implementations need to take in
account the case in which the interrupt happens in the middle of the execution of one of
the exposed routines, so that the processing done during the interrupt does not conflict
with the (possibly half-done) processing performed by the routine, especially when the
internal state of the implementation is modified by the routine.

The easiest way to avoid such conflicts is to simply set a flag when one of the exposed
routines starts its execution, and to reset it when the routine execution finishes. Then,
when the implementation's timer interrupt service routine starts, it checks the flag, and
when it is set, the processing step is delayed to the next timer interrupt.

This poses a problem: if the client software executes implementation routines in quick
succession (for example, inside a loop that waits for incoming data from a connection),
then no processing steps may be done in a long time, which can result in data loss or
other misbehavior of the implementation.

The [TCPIP_WAIT](#481-tcpip_wait-wait-for-a-processing-step-to-run) routine helps to solve this problem. On implementations that perform
its internal processing in processing steps, this routine should block until the next
processing step is finished. Client applications that repeatedly execute implementation
routines in a loop should call this routine once per loop iteration, to ensure that the
implementation's processing steps are performed.

On implementations that do not perform work based on processing steps (for example
implementations whose processing is done entirely by external hardware and are
therefore not tied to the timer interrupt), this routine can simply do nothing.
This routine should return with interrupts enabled.

**Note for implementors:** The easiest way to implement this routine is to look at the two
byte system variable stored at address FC9Eh. The value of this variable changes
whenever a timer interrupt occurs. Thus, it is enough to continuously look at the variable
value until it changes. Here is a sample implementation of this concept:

```
TIMER: equ 0FC9Eh

WAIT:
    ei
    ld de,(PREV_TIMER)
WAIT2:
    ld hl,(TIMER)
    ld (PREV_TIMER),hl
    ld a,h
    cp d
    ret nz
    ld a,l
    cp e
    ret nz
    jr WAIT2

PREV_TIMER:
    dw 0
```

**ERROR CODES**

This routine never fails. ERR_OK is always returned.


## 5. Change log

This section lists the changes introduced in all the existing versions of the specification.

### Version 1.1

- Added support for TLS on TCP connections:
  - TLS related capability and feature flags added to [TCPIP_GET_CAPAB](#412-tcpip_get_capab-get-information-about-the-tcpip-capabilities-and-features)
  - A new flag to request TLS, and an optional field for the server host name, added to the
    connection parameters block in [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection)
  - [TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection) now returns a flag
    that indicates if the connection is using TLS
  - [TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection) defines new
    TLS related cause reasons

- `TCPIP_TCP_FLUSH` has been renamed to `TCPIP_TCP_DISCARD` to avoid confussions, since "flush" 
in the context of data connections usually means "send all the existing data" and not "discard data without sending it".

- The description of `TCPIP_TCP_SEND` now includes the fact that requesting to send zero bytes is allowed,
and results in all the enqueued data being send in the PUSH flag is specified. 
This was true in v1.0 of the specification too, but not it's explicitly documented.

- Added bit 15 of the first set of capabilities flags, the entire second set of capabilities flags, 
bits 9-12 of the first set of features flags, and the WiFi link layer protocol identifier to
[TCPIP_GET_CAPAB](#412-tcpip_get_capab-get-information-about-the-tcpip-capabilities-and-features)

- [TCPIP_SEND_ECHO](#421-tcpip_send_echo-send-icmp-echo-message-ping) is now allowed to ignore the supplied value
for TTL, if the _"TTL can be specified in the parameters block of TCPIP_SEND_ECHO"_ capability flag is not set.

- The _"Automatically obtain the IP addresses, by using DHCP or an equivalent protocol"_ capability flag is now
deprecated, replaced by the new two more granular flags in the second flags block.

- [TCPIP_CONFIG_IP](#472-tcpip_config_ip-manually-configure-an-ip-address) can now return ERR_NOT_IMP
if the associated _"Manually set the ... IP address"_ capability flag for the address whose change was attempted
is not set.

- [TCPIP_CONFIG_TTL](#473-tcpip_config_ttl-getset-the-value-of-ttl-and-tos-for-outgoing-datagrams) can now return
ERR_NOT_IMP if getting the current values was requested but the _"Get the TTL used for outgoing datagrams"_
capability flag is not set.

- Added an explanation about the _"TCPIP_DNS_Q is a blocking operation"_ feature flag
 n the description of [TCPIP_DNS_Q](#431-tcpip_dns_q-start-a-host-name-resolution-query).

- Added an explanation about the _"TCPIP_TCP_OPEN is a blocking operation"_ feature flag,
about the _"TLS is supported for TCP connections"_ feature flag and about
the ESTABLISHED and CLOSE-WAIT states in the description of [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection).

- Added ERR_NO_CONN as a possible error code for [TCPIP_TCP_OPEN](#451-tcpip_tcp_open-open-a-tcp-connection).

- Added the remark about returning ESTABLISHED state on CLOSE_WAIT with pending incoming data in 
[TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection).

- Added implementation specific close reasons for [TCPIP_TCP_STATE](#454-tcpip_tcp_state-get-the-state-of-a-tcp-connection).

- Added the remark about discarding pending incoming data in [TCPIP_TCP_CLOSE](#452-tcpip_tcp_close-close-a-tcp-connection)
